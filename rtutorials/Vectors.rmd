Welcome to R! For the first few tutorials, I thought I would go over the most essential data structures.  Some examples are borrowed from The Art of R programming by Norman Matloff. Others are made up, for fun and profit. 

<h2> Vectors </h2>
```{r}
#### Vector Intro #### 
# Vectors are to R what six-block bricks are to Legos.  
x <- 6 
print(x)

# empty vectors can be assigned with the vector() function
emptyVector <- vector(mode="numeric",length=0)
print(emptyVector)

# BTW, you can check the requirements of a function using ?FunctionName()
?vector()

# Vectors can be combined with the c() (combine) function
myVector <- c(1,2,4)
print(myVector)

# You might notice R doesn't have scalars but really just vectors of length 1
oneElement <- 8 
print(length(oneElement))

# also, length() is a super useful function. 

# the length() function can be used to get the length of an object
threeElement <- c(2,4,6)
print(length(threeElement))

#### Modes #### 
# You should read up on modes
?mode

# Numeric modes can be either integers or floats 
doubleVector <- 6.6
print(mode(doubleVector))

# Now ints 
integerVector <- 6
print(mode(integerVector))

# BTW, you can coerce an R object by using the as.Type() function
print(as.integer(doubleVector)) # notice that the value is 6 rather than 6.6 

# Vectors can also be logical (but not illogical, because everything in R makes perfect sense )
logicalVector <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
print(mode(logicalVector))

# BTW, TRUE and FALSE can be shortened to T and F 
logicalVectorShort <- c(T,F,T)

# Strings and Text are held in character vectors 
characterVector <- c("GEOINT","Pathfinder")
print(mode(characterVector))

# vectors can support any R mode but like starter Pokemon, you only get to have one.
legalAssignment <- c(1,2,3,10) # all elements are numeric, mode will show numeric
print(mode(legalAssignment))

# pay attention when we try to mix things that shouldn't be mixed. Bleach and ammonia anyone? 
illegalAssignment <- c(TRUE,25,"hydrazine")
print(illegalAssignment)

# Nothing broke because R will force type coercion on vectors. Notice TRUE and 25 are characters.
print(mode(illegalAssignment))

#### Slicing and Dicing Vectors #### 
# we can assign a vector to play with using the the ?seq() function 
ourVector <- seq(1,100,1) # if we wanted to count by threes, you'd change the third variable from 1 to 3

# we could also have done it this way
ourVector <- c(1:100)

# we can subset vectors 
vector99 <- ourVector[99]
print(vector99)

# we can filter a vector by another vector
oneTen65 <- c(1,10,65)
ourSubset <- ourVector[oneTen65]
print(ourSubset)

# you can remove the elements of one vector from another
notOneTen65 <- ourVector[-oneTen65]

# We can use any() to check if our subset worked
f <- any(notOneTen65 == 1) # the double == sign is used for comparison, whereas a singe = is assignment
print(f)

t <- any(notOneTen65 == 2)
print(t)

# any() and all() are super useful. They return a logical vector based on the condition you want to check. 
allZeros <- c(0,0,0)

# we could also have assigned the allZeros variable using the rep() function
allZeros <- rep(0,3)
print(all(allZeros == 0))

if (all(allZeros == 0)){ # I haven't covered control flow yet, but you get it! 
  print("Yay!")
}

# we can also subset vectors using the which() function. It's fun to use which()! 
greater10Less30 <- ourVector[which(ourVector > 10 & ourVector < 30)]

# which returns a vector of indices where a condition is true for example, which element is == 99?
toyVector <- c(1,99,2)
index <- which(toyVector > 2) 
print(index) # notice it's the second element. 

# if we wanted the actual value we'd subset the orginal vector by our index  
print(toyVector[index])

#### Vectorized operations and recycling ####
# vector operations are much faster than looping and are supported by R 
# Say, if we wanted to subtract everything in ourVector by 3.
# we could do this:
minus3 <- c()
for (i in ourVector){
  j <- i - 3
  minus3 <- c(minus3,j)
}

# It's much better to just do this 
betterMinus3 <- ourVector - 3 

# We can time the difference with a larger vector 
bigVector <- c(1:100000)
minus3 <- c()
ptm <- proc.time()
for(i in bigVector){
  j <- i - 3
  minus3 <- c(minus3,j)
  
}
t <- proc.time() - ptm 

# Now with a vector 
ptm <- proc.time()
betterMinus3 <- bigVector - 3
t <- proc.time() - ptm
print(t)

v <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(1,2,3,4)
print(b - 1) 
# notice, that it recylced the first element of v and subtracted it from the fourth element of b

#### Fun with functions and vectors #### 
# recall that variable ourVector is a numeric vector with values 1:100
print(length(ourVector))

# If we wanted to get the mean of ourVector, we'd use mean
print(mean(ourVector))


# Similarly, we could grab the median using median 
print(median(ourVector))

# we could add a new number to our vector using the orginal vector and c()
ourVector <- c(ourVector,101)

# This gives us a new median
print(median(ourVector))

# we could sort ourVector using sort(). Let's make it decreasing rather than increasing
print(ourVector[1])

ourVector <- sort(ourVector,decreasing=TRUE)
print(ourVector[1])

```


<h2> Vector Challenges </h2> 
<ol>
  <li> Create a vector,  called myVector and assign it the values 1 through 1000, increasing by 3s.</li>
  <li> Print out the 213th element of myVector. </li>
  <li> Create a subset of myVector called truncatedVector. Include only the values greater than 200 but less than 700. </li>
  <li> How many elements are in truncated vector? </li>
  <li> Print out the mean of truncatedVector. </li> 
  <li> Combine your orginal myVector along with truncatedVector. What's the median? </li>
</ol>
